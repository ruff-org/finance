## How to prepare
Statement of shareholders equity is normally prepared in vertical format, i.e. the equity components appear as column headings and changes during the year appear as row headings.

EXAMPLE OF ROWS:

- Balance as at 1-Jul-13	
- Issue of bonus shares	
- Issue of new shares	
- Net income
- Transfer to capital reserve	
- Dividends	
- Share buyback	
- Reversal of revaluation
  - This adjustment is only required under IFRS. If a fixed asset is revalued upwards, it increased the asset book value and also increases revaluation surplus, which is a shareholdersâ€™ equity component. When the same asset is subsequently revalued down, the downward revaluation is written off to the extent of any upward revaluation originally credit to revaluation surplus in relation to that asset. 
- Balance as at 30-Jun-14
