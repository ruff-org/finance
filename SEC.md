# Registering Securities with the SEC
- A description of the company's properties and business;
- A description of the security to be offered for sale;
- Information about the management of the company; and
- Financial statements certified by independent accountants.

Registration statements and prospectuses become public shortly after the company files them with the SEC. All companies, domestic and foreign, are required to file registration statements and other forms electronically. Investors can then access registration and other company filings using EDGAR.

Not all offerings of securities must be registered with the SEC. The most common exemptions from the registration requirements include:

- Private offerings to a limited number of persons or institutions;
- Offerings of limited size;
- Intrastate offerings; and
- Securities of municipal, state, and federal governments.

- Form S-1
- Prospectus Document

In the prospectus, your company must clearly describe important information about its business operations, financial condition, results of operations, risk factors, and management. The prospectus must also include audited financial statements.
